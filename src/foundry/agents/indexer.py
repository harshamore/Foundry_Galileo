"""The Indexer role (spec.md §5.2) as a DeepAgents SubAgent.

Indexing itself is deterministic (see foundry.indexer.parser) -- FR-020
prohibits an LLM from being the sole source of the function inventory. This
subagent wraps the *query interface* (FR-022) so downstream roles -- and,
in this section's demo, a small main agent -- can answer questions about
the target grounded in that deterministic index, not model recall.

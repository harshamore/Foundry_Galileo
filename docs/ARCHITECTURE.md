# Architecture

This is a **working rebuild**, not a stub scaffold: the substrate below runs
and is tested. It follows Cisco's [Foundry Security
Spec](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/foundry-security-spec) (`SEED` v0.1.0,
reproduced unmodified at `../trial-run/specs/001-foundry/spec.md` and
`../trial-run/.specify/memory/constitution.md`), rebuilt on
[DeepAgents](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents) as the multi-agent
runtime and [CodeGuard](https://github.com/cosai-oasis/project-codeguard) as
the Detector's rule corpus. See `docs/CONSTITUTION_MAPPING.md` for the
principle-by-principle enforcement table and `docs/CODEGUARD_INTEGRATION.md`
for the rule-corpus details.

## Shape (unchanged from the spec)

A fleet of role-specialized agents, coordinated through a shared substrate,
supervised by an Orchestrator, operating on a target within a sandbox. See
spec.md §4.1 for the full diagram; the eight core roles are Orchestrator,
Indexer, Cartographer, Detector, Triager, Validator, Coverage-Guide, and
Reporter.

**Confirmed scope for this build:**
- Source-only for now — no live testbed. The Validator runs in the spec's
  own documented degraded mode (FR-066): verifies a PoC exists and is
  well-formed, never sets `exploited`. A testbed gets added later.
- LLM provider: OpenAI, key entered per-session (Colab `getpass`, never
  committed).
- Reporter output: local markdown files (one per finding + a rollup), no
  issue-tracker integration yet.
- All 8 core roles planned, Validator degraded rather than merged/omitted.
  The 5 extension roles (Deep-Tester, Variant-Hunter, Attack-Mapper,
  Remediator, Self-Improver) are not built — per the spec's own
  recommendation for a first build.

## What's actually implemented right now

All eight core roles from spec.md §4.2, now wired into one running pipeline
(Orchestrator's lifecycle role is this notebook's own `create_deep_agent`
calls — the Full Pipeline section wires all eight subagents into a single
call rather than one per role, but no dedicated Orchestrator subagent
exists; Validator runs degraded, no testbed):

                                 tracing, in one file, never a separate notebook per role
```

The Indexer's actual indexing (parsing, call graph, persistence, queries) has
no LLM dependency — FR-020 requires a deterministic parser, not model
extraction. The Cartographer is the opposite case: its real content IS meant
to be LLM-authored, so the structural guarantee is FR-036a instead — every
section gets a mechanically-derived fallback before any agent runs, proven
in the notebook by intentionally letting the live agent call fail (invalid
key) and confirming every section still reads `source=fallback` rather than
being empty. The Detector is LLM-authored like the Cartographer, but its
structural guarantee is Constitution II instead: neither the rule-sweep nor
the exploratory subagent has any tool that reaches a human or an issue
tracker, only `queue_candidate` — so no matter what either agent decides,
"surface only what survives" holds by construction. The Triager adds no new
enforcement mechanism of its own — the evidence gate it calls has been built
and tested since the Substrate section; this section is what finally puts a
live agent's real (possibly wrong) citations through it. Coverage-Guide is
the same shape again, one level up: every MUST-level requirement (FR-067
derive checklist, FR-069 check off from evidence, FR-070 directed tasks,
FR-071 the coverage-complete flag, FR-074 don't rebuild from scratch) is
mechanical, exercised directly from `CoverageStore` with no LLM involved --
"coverage measures attempt, not outcome" is an evidence check, the same way
`BudgetGovernor.should_stop()` is a mechanical conjunction. The payoff:
`coverage_store.is_complete()` now feeds `gov.should_stop()` directly,
closing Constitution VI end to end with real inputs on both sides instead
of the hand-typed booleans the Substrate section's own tests used.

The Reporter is the last role and Constitution II's endpoint: only
`true-positive` findings are ever eligible, checked against the finding
store itself (FR-079) rather than trusted from the model, and every report
is scanned for forbidden model/provider/internal-identifier mentions before
a byte is written (FR-083) -- both proven live in the notebook by
deliberately trying to publish a `needs-review` finding and a report that
names the model, and watching both get rejected with the real reason, not
a hand-crafted test assertion. FR-076/077 (weakness taxonomy and severity
scheme, both left open by the spec's own `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers)
are resolved for this build as CWE and a four-tier qualitative scale
(critical/high/medium/low) -- a judgment call, documented here rather than
silently made. FR-081's rollup (counts, component grouping, coverage
status) is entirely deterministic aggregation, no LLM needed to compute
any of it. Nine real OpenAI calls exist in this build now (Indexer,
Cartographer, Detector rule-sweep, Detector exploratory, Triager,
Coverage-Guide, Reporter, Detector directed, and the Full Pipeline's
all-eight-subagents call), each a `create_deep_agent` main agent delegating
through the `task` tool to prove the tool interface is usable by an LLM,
not just by pytest.

**The directed-detection loop, closed (FR-070) — the Full Pipeline
section.** `queue_directed_tasks` writes real, claimable tasks to the
`WorkQueue`; until this section nothing consumed them. Closing this
surfaced a real gap, not just a missing consumer: `CoverageStore.
review_cycle()` closes a checklist item on *evidence* (a `findings` row or
a `coverage_log` sweep matching that exact area/goal), not on work-queue
status — so a directed pass that checks an area and finds nothing would
have drained its task with no effect on coverage at all. Fixed at the tool
layer: `build_directed_task_tools`'s `complete_directed_task`
(`src/foundry/detector/tools.py`) now always calls `CoverageStore.
record_sweep()` using the *claimed task's own* area/goal, tracked
server-side rather than re-supplied by the model, regardless of whether
`queue_candidate` was also called — the same "tool decides what counts as
evidence, model just supplies what it found" shape as the Triager's real
resolver. `WorkQueue.claim_next()` gained a `task_type_prefix` parameter
(`tests/test_finding_store.py`) so a directed Detector can claim "any
directed-detection task" without knowing the exact area/goal-encoded
`task_type` up front. Proven live in the notebook and in
`tests/test_detector.py::test_complete_directed_task_closes_the_matching_coverage_checklist_item`.

**One agent, every role — also the Full Pipeline section.** All eight
subagents (indexer, cartographer, detector ×3, triager, coverage-guide,
reporter) now register on a single `create_deep_agent(...)` call instead
of one call per role, the actual shape an Orchestrator wires up. This adds
no new enforcement mechanism — Constitution II still holds per-subagent's
own `tools` list regardless of how many subagents share one main agent —
but it is the first point in this build where the main agent has more than
one subagent to choose between on a real request.

**Optional Galileo AI tracing — its own Observability section, ahead of
Substrate.** A `GalileoCallback` attached to every real `agent.invoke(...)`
call, added purely at the invocation edges (`src/foundry/observability/
galileo.py`) — confirmed before building it that this touches zero lines
in any Substrate or role store, so it can't affect anything this document's
constitution mapping enforces. Strictly opt-in (`None`/no-op without
`GALILEO_API_KEY`) and fails soft (a bad key or unreachable Galileo account
degrades to "no tracing," verified against a real, deliberately invalid key
returning a real HTTP 401, caught and reported, never raised) — a
deliberate asymmetry with `OPENAI_API_KEY`, which is allowed to raise since
that's the actual work failing. See `docs/OBSERVABILITY.md` for the full
trace/span mapping and the constraints worth knowing (free-tier trace
budget, SaaS data exposure, self-hosting is Enterprise-only).

**Deferred by design, not forgotten**: FR-038 (dependency scanning) is
skipped for the same reason FR-039 (secret scanning) mostly overlaps with
CodeGuard's own `hardcoded-credentials` rule: the toy target has no
third-party dependency manifest to scan. FR-046 (exploratory Detector
instances consult the coverage log before choosing an area) is
half-addressed: the `coverage_log` table and `CoverageStore.record_sweep()`
exist and are now exercised by the directed half, but the exploratory
subagent doesn't call it. FR-084 (every code location a permalink that
resolves for the reader) isn't attempted -- reports cite `path:line-range`
directly instead, since there's no commit-pinned VCS host story for a toy
target parsed straight off disk; the spec itself leaves this one's
mechanics as a `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]`.

**A live-only failure mode worth knowing about**: `create_deep_agent`
attaches a default filesystem middleware to every agent and subagent
(`ls`/`read_file`/`glob`/... bound to an empty, in-memory virtual
filesystem) regardless of the `tools` list a `SubAgent` dict specifies. The
first live Cartographer run tried `ls /`, `ls /workspace`, and a recursive
glob instead of the real index tools it was given, found nothing, and wrote
"no target code discoverable" into every section (still correctly labeled
`source=llm` — the write tools *were* called, just with bad content, which
is exactly why FR-036a's structural fallback matters). `src/foundry/agents/
_middleware.py::minimal_filesystem_middleware()` restricts this down to the
one tool the framework requires (`read_file` can't be excluded), applied to
both the Indexer and Cartographer subagents and their main agents; the
system prompt also now explicitly tells the model to ignore it.

## What's next (roadmap, not yet built)

All eight core roles are built, and three pieces that were previously
deferred — the directed-detection loop closure, the all-subagents
pipeline, and optional Galileo tracing — are done. What's left is
deliberately out of scope for this build, not oversight:

- A dedicated Orchestrator subagent with `interrupt_on`-gated tools
  (`mark_coverage_complete`, `override_verdict`) for Constitution X ("the
  operator outranks every agent") — this notebook's sequence of
  `create_deep_agent` calls stands in for orchestration, but no tool
  anywhere requires explicit operator approval before executing.
- A real testbed, which would take the Validator out of degraded mode
  (Constitution VII) and give Constitution IX (sandbox by infrastructure)
  something real to attach to.
- Genuinely concurrent subagent instances (multiple Detector or Triager
  workers running at once against a real, larger target), which is what
  would actually exercise Constitution V beyond what a single top-level
  call with occasional parallel tool dispatch already covers. Once this
  lands, Galileo trace timestamps are a natural way to *show* the
  concurrency actually happened, not just assert it.
- Deeper Galileo instrumentation (manual `GalileoLogger` spans inside
  `FindingStore.assign_verdict()`, `CoverageStore.review_cycle()`, and
  `BudgetGovernor.should_stop()`), so evidence-gate demotions and coverage
  closures become structured, queryable Galileo data instead of text
  buried in tool outputs — deliberately deferred in favor of automatic-only
  tracing first; see `docs/OBSERVABILITY.md`.

See `docs/CONSTITUTION_MAPPING.md` for the full principle-by-principle
status.

## Quickstart

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -e ".[dev]"
.venv/bin/python scripts/fetch_codeguard_rules.py

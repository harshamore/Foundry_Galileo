# foundry-harness

An agentic security evaluation harness: [DeepAgents](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents)
as the multi-agent runtime, [CodeGuard](https://github.com/cosai-oasis/project-codeguard)
as the Detector's rule corpus, built against Cisco's open-source [Foundry
Security Spec](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/foundry-security-spec) and its
11-principle constitution.

**Status:** all eight core roles are built, tested, and wired into one
running pipeline — the substrate (finding store, work queue, budget
governor), Indexer, Cartographer, Detector (rule-sweep, exploratory, and
directed), Triager, Coverage-Guide, and Reporter. Coverage-Guide's
directed-detection loop is closed end to end (a live Detector actually
consumes and closes `WorkQueue` gaps, not just drains them), and a Full
Pipeline section wires all eight subagents into a single `create_deep_agent`
call instead of one per role. Optional Galileo AI tracing (automatic-only
scope, opt-in, fails soft) is wired into every real agent call — see
`docs/OBSERVABILITY.md`. Validator runs degraded (no testbed configured);
Orchestrator's lifecycle role is still the notebook's own `create_deep_agent`
calls, not a dedicated subagent with operator-approval gates — see
`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for the full picture and `docs/CONSTITUTION_MAPPING.md`
for how each constitution principle maps to actual code.

## What's here

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `src/foundry/substrate/` | `FindingStore` (evidence gate, fingerprinting), `WorkQueue` (atomic claim, heartbeat lease), `BudgetGovernor` (coverage-before-yield stop condition) |
| `src/foundry/indexer/` | `parser.py` (AST-based function inventory, decorators included, + call graph, no LLM), `store.py` (query interface + the real evidence-gate resolver), `tools.py` (LangChain tool wrappers) |
| `src/foundry/cartographer/` | `store.py` (security map + digest, FR-035), `fallback.py` (per-section deterministic fallback, FR-036a, no LLM), `tools.py` (LangChain tool wrappers) |
| `src/foundry/codeguard/` | `loader.py` (parses the vendored rule corpus, FR-041, no LLM), `tools.py` (`list_rules`/`get_rule`) |
| `src/foundry/detector/tools.py` | `queue_candidate`/`record_rule_gap` — the Detector's only writes, both internal-only (Constitution II) — plus `build_directed_task_tools` (`claim_directed_task`/`complete_directed_task`), which consumes Coverage-Guide's queued gaps and always leaves a coverage-log sweep as evidence, whether or not anything was found |
| `src/foundry/triager/tools.py` | `list_candidates`/`get_candidate`/`assign_verdict` — `assign_verdict` binds the real Indexer resolver as a closure the model can't see or influence |
| `src/foundry/coverage/` | `store.py` (`CoverageStore`: the whole FR-067/069/070/071/074 mechanism, no LLM), `tools.py` (one read-only tool, `get_coverage_report`) |
| `src/foundry/reporter/` | `classification.py` (CWE lookup + the FR-083 denylist scan, no LLM), `store.py` (`ReporterStore`: FR-079/081/083 enforced structurally), `tools.py` (LangChain tool wrappers) |
| `src/foundry/observability/galileo.py` | Optional Galileo AI tracing, automatic-only scope — `build_galileo_callback()`/`galileo_run_config()`/`console_url()`. Wired only at `agent.invoke()` call sites; touches no Substrate or role store. `None`/no-op whenever `GALILEO_API_KEY` isn't set, never raises even when set and unreachable |
| `src/foundry/agents/` | All eight core roles' SubAgents (Indexer, Cartographer, Detector ×3 — rule-sweep, exploratory, directed —, Triager, Coverage-Guide, Reporter), plus `_middleware.py`'s shared filesystem-tool restriction |
| `tests/` (10 files) | 131 tests total proving the constitution's I/II/III/IV/VI/VIII/XI principles and FR-020/021/022/025/026/031/041/042/054/067/068/069/070/071/074/076/079/081/083, mechanically, no LLM, no external network calls |
| `data/codeguard/rules/` | Vendored CodeGuard rule corpus (fetched, not committed — run `scripts/fetch_codeguard_rules.py`) |
| `data/toy_target/vulnerable_app.py` | Small deliberately-vulnerable Flask app; the shared target every section parses/queries |
| `notebooks/01_substrate.ipynb` | The single, growing Colab notebook — setup, observability, substrate, and every role's section get appended here as they're built |
| `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` | Full writeup: shape, roadmap, quickstart |
| `docs/CONSTITUTION_MAPPING.md` | Principle → enforcing code, updated as each piece lands |
| `docs/CODEGUARD_INTEGRATION.md` | How the rule corpus is fetched, pinned, and (eventually) consumed by the Detector |
| `docs/OBSERVABILITY.md` | Galileo integration: scope, trace/span mapping, opt-in/fail-soft design, constraints (free-tier trace budget, SaaS data exposure) |

## Quickstart (local)

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -e ".[dev]"
.venv/bin/python scripts/fetch_codeguard_rules.py
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

No API key needed for any of the above. `pip install -e ".[dev,observability]"` additionally installs the `galileo` SDK if you want `tests/test_observability.py`'s positive-path tests to run instead of skip — still no real Galileo account or network call needed for tests either way.

## Quickstart (Colab)

Open `notebooks/01_substrate.ipynb` in Colab — this is the **one notebook**
the whole harness gets built in. Section 1 (Setup) clones this repo,
installs dependencies, fetches the CodeGuard rules, and prompts for an
OpenAI key via `getpass` (not stored). Section 2 (Observability) optionally
prompts for a Galileo API key via `getpass` — leave it blank to skip
entirely; every later section runs identically either way, just untraced.
If a key is entered, every real agent call from here on is captured as a
Galileo trace, tagged by role — see `docs/OBSERVABILITY.md`. Section 3
(Substrate) runs the same proofs as the test suite, interactively, no
OpenAI calls yet. Section 4 (Indexer) parses the toy target
deterministically, then makes a real OpenAI call delegating a question to
the Indexer subagent. Section 5 (Cartographer) writes a deterministic
fallback for every security-map section first (FR-036a — the map is never
empty), then a real OpenAI call lets the Cartographer subagent overwrite
those with actual analysis. Section 6 (Detector) loads the CodeGuard rule
corpus, then makes two real OpenAI calls — rule-sweep (systematic, checks
every function against the corpus) and exploratory hunting (free-form,
front-loaded with the Cartographer's security-map digest) — queuing
candidate findings into SQLite. Section 7 (Triager) makes one more real
OpenAI call, investigating every queued candidate and assigning verdicts
through the same evidence gate the Substrate section proved standalone —
a citation naming a symbol that doesn't actually exist gets auto-demoted
from `true-positive` to `needs-review`, live. Section 8 (Coverage-Guide)
builds and checks a coverage checklist mechanically (no OpenAI call needed
for any of it), wires the result directly into the Substrate section's
`BudgetGovernor` — closing Constitution VI end to end with real inputs
instead of hand-typed booleans — then makes one real OpenAI call for a
short remaining-work narrative. Section 9 (Reporter), the last core role,
publishes a self-contained report for every `true-positive` finding and a
rollup — with two live demos of its own: publishing a `needs-review`
finding gets rejected outright, and publishing a report that names the
model or provider gets rejected too, both before anything is written to
disk. Each real call costs a small real amount on `gpt-5.6-luna`. Section
10 (Full Pipeline) closes the two pieces deliberately deferred earlier: a
real `detector-directed` subagent claims and investigates every
directed-detection task Coverage-Guide queued, closing each coverage-
checklist item with a permanent evidence record whether or not anything
was found (not just draining the queue) — then all eight subagents get
wired into a single `create_deep_agent(...)` call, the actual shape an
Orchestrator wires up, rather than one call per role. Any future work gets
appended the same way — every section in this same notebook, never a
separate file, so nothing later ever loses the environment setup
established.
